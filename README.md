## About This Project

After applying to so many jobs and having to keep track of all the jobs in a clutered spreadhseet, I decided that this needs to change. As a result, I have developed the Job Application Tracker. This Application is utilized to keep track of your application status as you track your way to success!

## Get Started

To run this application, you can clone the repository, or download this jar file [here](www.google.com).

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources and resources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
